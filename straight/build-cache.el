property list containing e.g. `:type', `:local-repo', `:files',

First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If
NO-CLONE is a function, then it is called with two arguments: the
package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If

package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored

occurs.

 CMD-NAME is the name of the new command, a symbol.

 DIRECTORY is the directory/buffer name of the Dired buffer that the
  new command shows.  It is the car of the list returned by
  `dired-read-dir-and-switches'.

 FILES is the list of file and directory names to be shown in the
  Dired buffer.

 Non-nil MSG-P means echo the name of the new command.

___

The defined commands produce a Dired buffer that lists the files and
directories chosen when they were defined, as absolute file names.
This set of files never changes, regardless of any changes to the
content of the directory in which you created the commands.

Using any prefix arg with the commands prompts for the `ls' switches
to use.

Such commands are particularly useful to dired a set of files and dirs
that results from some possibly long-lasting command, such as
`find-dired'.  This can be quicker than recalculating the set of files
to Dired, but the set of files used is not necessarily up-to-date with
respect to what a new calculation would produce.

You can chance the values of variables
`diredp-snapshot-cmd-time-format'
`diredp-snapshot-cmd-buffer-name-format', to change format of the
Dired buffer name.

such a buffer for persistent access.

No prefix arg or a plain prefix arg (`C-u', `C-u C-u', etc.) means

With a prefix arg:
* If 0, `-', or plain (`C-u') then you are prompted for the `ls'
  switches to use.
* If not plain (`C-u') then:
  * If >= 0 then the files to include are read, one by one.

You are prompted for the name of the Dired union buffer.  Completion
against names of existing Dired buffers is available, but you can
enter any other name to create a new Dired buffer of that name.

If the union buffer name you choose names an existing Dired buffer,
then what happens depends on whether that buffer is an ordinary Dired
directory listing or a list of arbitrary file names.  That is, it
depends on whether `dired-directory' is a directory name or a cons of
a Dired buffer name plus file names.

* If the buffer is an ordinary Dired listing, then it is converted to
  an explicit list of absolute file names, just as if these had been
  chosen individually.  The existing buffer and window are replaced by
  new ones that show the explicit listing.  (This replacement is
  necessary because the list of files contained in an ordinary Dired
  listing cannot be modified.)

* If the buffer lists arbitrary file names explicitly, then it is
  updated to include also the files from any Dired buffers and any
  additional files that you specify.

If the union buffer name you choose does not name an existing Dired
buffer, then its `default-directory' is the same as the
`default-directory' before invoking the command.

If you use a non-positive prefix arg, then you can next choose
additional file and directory names to add to the listing.  Use `C-g'
when done choosing them.

Any directory names you choose this way are included as single entries
in the listing - the directory contents are not included (these
directories are not unioned).  To instead include the contents of a
directory chosen this way, use a glob pattern: `/*' after the
directory name.

You are then prompted for the Dired buffers to union.  Use `C-g' when
done choosing them.  These Dired listings to union are included in the
order that you chose them, and each entry is listed only once in the
new Dired buffer.

The new Dired listing respects the markings, subdirectory insertions,
and hidden subdirectories of the selected Dired listings.  However, in
case of conflict between marked or unmarked status for the same entry,
the entry is marked.  Similarly, in case of conflict over an included
subdirectory between it being hidden or shown, it is hidden, but its
contained files are also listed.

The marked-file bookmarks are added to file BOOKMARK-FILE, but this

make it current, just jump to the bookmark-file bookmark created by
this command.  That bookmark (which bookmarks BOOKMARK-FILE) is
defined in that current bookmark file.

Example:

 Bookmark file `~/.emacs.bmk' is current before invoking this command.
 The current (Dired) directory is `/foo/bar'.
 The marked files are bookmarked in the (possibly new) bookmark file
   `/foo/bar/.emacs.bmk'.
 The bookmarks for the marked files have names prefixed by `FOOBAR '.
 The name of the bookmark-file bookmark is `Foobar Files'.
 Bookmark `Foobar Files' is itself in bookmark file `~/.emacs.bmk'.
 Bookmark file `~/.emacs.bmk' is current after invoking this command.

You are prompted for the name of the bookmark-file bookmark, the
BOOKMARK-FILE for the marked-file bookmarks, and a PREFIX string for
each of the marked-file bookmarks.

`.' and `..' are never marked or unmarked by this command.

Whether to mark or unmark, and what form of file name to match, are
governed by the prefix argument.  For this, a plain (`C-u') or a
double-plain (`C-u C-u') prefix arg is considered only as such - it is
not considered numerically.

Whether to mark or unmark:

 - No prefix arg, a positive arg, or a negative arg means MARK.

 - Plain (`C-u'), double-plain (`C-u C-u'), or zero (e.g. `M-0' means
   UNMARK.

The form of the file names used for matching:

 - No prefix arg (to mark) or a plain prefix arg (`C-u', to unmark)
   means use the relative file name (no directory part).

 - A positive arg (e.g. `M-9', to mark) or a double plain arg (`C-u
   C-u', to unmark) means construct the file name relative to
   `default-directory'.

   For an entry in an inserted subdir listing, this means prefix the
   relative file name (no directory part) with the subdir name
   relative to `default-directory'.

 - A negative arg (e.g. `M--', to mark) or a zero arg (e.g. `M-0'), to
   unmark) means use the absolute file name, that is, including all
   directory components.

Note that the default matching behavior of this command is different
for Dired+ than it is for vanilla Emacs.  Using a positive prefix arg
or a double plain prefix arg (`C-u C-u') gives you the same behavior
as vanilla Emacs (marking or unmarking, respectively): matching
against names that are relative to the `default-directory'.

What Dired+ offers in addition is the possibility to match against
names that are relative (have no directory part - e.g. no prefix arg
or a single `C-u', to mark & unmark, respectively), or absolute (`M--'
or `M-0', respectively).

The default behavior uses relative names because this
is likely to be the more common use case.  But matching against
absolute names gives you more flexibility.

REGEXP is an Emacs regexp, not a shell wildcard.  Thus, use `\\.o$'
for object files--just `.o' might mark more than you might expect.
REGEXP is added to `regexp-search-ring', for subsequent regexp search.

When called from Lisp:

 MARKER-CHAR is the marker character - used for `dired-marker-char'.

 NAME-FORM determines the form of file name matched against REGEXP:

   * nil:           names that are relative to `default-directory'
   * `no-dir':      relative names (no directory part)
   * Other non-nil: absolute names

   (NAME-FORM differs from the LOCALP arg of `dired-get-filename' in
   that the nil and other non-nil cases are swapped.  This is
   unfortunate, but it is to keep nil NAME-FORM compatible with the
   vanilla Emacs behavior, where this arg does not exist.)

PREDICATE is a lisp sexp that can refer to the following symbols as

    `mode'   [string]  file permission bits, e.g. \"-rw-r--r--\"
    `nlink'  [integer] number of links to file
    `size'   [integer] file size in bytes
    `uid'    [string]  owner
    `gid'    [string]  group (If the gid is not displayed by `ls',
                       this will still be set (to the same as uid))
    `time'   [string]  the time that `ls' displays, e.g. \"Feb 12 14:17\"
    `name'   [string]  the name of the file
    `sym'    [string]  if file is a symbolic link, the linked-to name,
                       else \"\"
    `inode'  [integer] the inode of the file (only for `ls -i' output)
    `blks'   [integer] the size of the file for `ls -s' output
                       (ususally in blocks or, with `-k', in Kbytes)

There's an ambiguity when a single integer not followed by a unit
prefix precedes the file mode: It is then parsed as inode number
and not as block size (this always works for GNU coreutils ls).

Another limitation is that the uid field is needed for the
function to work correctly.  In particular, the field is not
present for some values of `ls-lisp-emulation'.

This function operates only on the Dired buffer content.  It does not
refer at all to the underlying file system.  Contrast this with
`find-dired', which might be preferable for the task at hand.

NAME should be a symbol, it will be the prefix of all functions

BODY has the format:

    (BODY-MAP BODY-KEY &rest BODY-PLIST)

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
Hydra.  When DOCSTRING starts with a newline, special Ruby-style
substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

    (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST)

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return

Adding the above bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook'

doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

the key bindings have already been added.

We recommend that you bind \"C-c g\" instead of \"C-c M-g\" to

easy.  Complete documentation is available online at URL
`https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/'.  Please report issues and
request features at URL `https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck'.

`FlyC-'    Flycheck doesn't have a checker for this buffer.

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0; info is -10, warning is 10, and
     error is 100.

     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

`:compilation-level LEVEL'

     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.

     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.

`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.

`:fringe-bitmap BITMAPS'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level, or a cons of two bitmaps (one for
     narrow fringes and one for wide fringes).  See Info node
     `(elisp)Fringe Bitmaps' for more information about fringe
     bitmaps, including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

`:margin-spec SPEC'
     A display specification indicating what to display in the
     margin when `flycheck-indication-mode' is `left-margin' or
     `right-margin'.  See Info node `(elisp)Displaying in the
     Margins'.  If omitted, Flycheck generates an image spec from
     the fringe bitmap.

     level in the error list.  See `flycheck-list-errors'.

In addition to the properties understood by
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.

`:command COMMAND'
     The command to run for syntax checking.

     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.

`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.

`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.

`:standard-input t'
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.

     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the
     contents of the buffer on standard input.

     Defaults to nil.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.

                  result)))

If FINISH-FUNC is nil or missing, a future is returned that can
be inspected using `async-get', blocking until the value is
ready.  Example:

    (let ((proc (async-start
                   ;; What to do in the child process
                   (lambda ()

        (message \"Waiting on async process, result should be 222: %s\"
                 (async-get proc)))

If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     \\='ignore)

Special case:
If the output of START-FUNC is a string with properties
e.g. (buffer-string) RESULT will be transformed in a list where the
car is the string itself (without props) and the cdr the rest of
properties, this allows using in FINISH-FUNC the string without
properties and then apply the properties in cdr to this string (if
needed).
Properties handling special objects like markers are returned as
list to allow restoring them later.
See <https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/issues/145> for more infos.

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to
